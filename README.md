# theoryProject

Run the program using
 #!/bin/bash
    g++ main.cpp -o main
./main

You should create a file called README.md. 
This will describe what your code does - 
    give a short background in context-free grammars, 
    and explain the purpose of your code. 
Your README will also explain exactly how to run your program. 
It will explain what programming language I need to use, and it will explain how to run the program. 
You should write your README for the target audience of someone who has never seen your code before and is completely unfamiliar with the project.
