Language L = {a^nb^n | n => 0}
Step 1: creating a new start variable
S -> X
X -> aXb | e

Step 2:
remove the rule X -> e, add a copy of every rule that includes X with X removed
S -> X
X -> aXb | ab

Step 3:
Remove S-> X
S -> 
x -> aXb | ab

replacing X -> u with S -> u
S -> aXb | ab
x -> aXb | ab

Step 4:
we can't have X -> aXb or S -> aXb
S -> aXb | ab
X -> ab

breaking up aXb into smaller rules
S -> aJ | ab
X -> aJ | ab
J -> Xb

Step 7:
Adding special varaible for each terminal symbol

A -> a
B -> b
Final grammar:
S -> AJ | AB
K -> XB
X -> AJ
J -> Xb
A -> a
B -> b
